# Description

**ProScene** (pronounced similar as the Czech word **"prosím"** which means **"please"**) is a free-software java library which provides classes to ease the creation of interactive 2D/3D scenes in [Processing](http://processing.org).

**ProScene** extensively uses **interactive frames**, i.e., coordinate systems that can be controlled with any [HID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device), allowing to easily setup an interactive 2D or 3D scene.

**ProScene** provides seemless integration with **Processing**: its API has been designed to fit that of **Processing** and its implementation has been optimized to work along side with it. It suppports all major **Processing** flavours: Desktop, JS, and Android.

**ProScene** support is led by the active and great Processing community at its [forum](http://forum.processing.org/two/search?Search=proscene) where you can reach us. News and technical details are found at our [blog](http://nakednous.github.io/).

# Philosophy

One of the main Proscene goals is to provide [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) researchers with a common and simple, yet fully customizable, framework to test different experimental ideas involving
the _three universal interaction tasks_: Object selection & manipulation, including the scene point-of-view; and, application control. For further details please refer to [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235271101730002X).

# Key features

* *Tested* under Linux, Mac OSX and Windows, and properly works with the JAVA2D, FX2D, P2D and P3D **Processing** renderers. No special dependencies or requirements needed (apart of course from [Processing >= 3.2.4](https://github.com/processing/processing/releases)).
* It supports all major **Processing** flavours: Desktop, Android (since [Proscene v-3.0.0-beta.6](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/tag/v-3.0.0-beta.6)) and (soon) JS.
* API design that provides seemless integration with **Processing** (e.g., providing flexible animation and drawing mechanisms), and allows extensibility of its key features.
* Generic support to [Human Interface Devices (HIDs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device), including not only the mouse and the keyboard, but advanced HID's such as a [touchscreen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen), a [space navigator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Dconnexion) or a [kinect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect).
* Keyboard shortcuts and HID bindings customization.
* Hierarchical coordinate systems (frames), with functions to convert between them.
* Interactive frames (including the camera) which may be manipulated by any HID.
* Arcball, walkthrough and third person camera modes.
* Default interactivity to your **Processing** scenes through the mouse (or touchscreen) and keyboard that simply does what you expect.
* Visibility culling: Back-face and view-frustum culling.
* Keyframes.
* Animation framework.
* Object picking.
* Screen drawing, i.e., drawing of 2d primitives on top of another (2d or 3d) scene.
* Off-screen rendering mode support.
* Save and load configurations.
* 2D and 3D Interactive [mini-maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-map).
* Handy set of complete documented [examples](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/tree/master/examples) that illustrates the use of the package.
* A complete [API reference documentation](http://remixlab.github.io/proscene-javadocs/).
* Active support and continuous discussions led by the [Processing community](http://forum.processing.org/two/search?Search=proscene).
* Last but not least, released as free software under the terms of the [GPL-v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

# Origin of the name

*ProScene* not only means a *"pro-scene"*, but it is a two-phoneme word pronounced similar as the Czech word *"prosím"* (which means *"please"*), obtained by removing the middle phoneme (*"ce"*) of the word *pro-ce-ssing*. The name *"ProScene"* thus suggests the main goal of the package, which is to help you _shorten_ the creation of interactive 2D/3D scenes in **Processing**.

# Usage

All library features requires a `Scene` object (which is the main package class) to be instantiated (usually within your sketch setup method). There are two ways to do that:

1. **Direct instantiation**. In this case you should instantiate your own Scene object at the `PApplet.setup()` function.
2. **Inheritance**. In this case, once you declare a `Scene` derived class, you should implement `proscenium()` which defines the objects in your scene. Just make sure to define the `PApplet.draw()` method, even if it's empty.

See the examples **BasicUse**, **AlternativeUse**, and **StandardCamera** for an illustration of these techniques. To get start using the library and learn
its main features, have a look at the complete set of well documented examples that come along with it. Other uses are also covered in the example set and
include (but are not limited to): drawing mechanisms, animation framework, and camera and keyboard customization. Advanced users may take full advantage of
the fully documented [API reference](http://remixlab.github.io/proscene-javadocs/) (which is also
included in the package file).

# Installation

Import/update it directly from your PDE. Otherwise download your release from [here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases) and extract it to your sketchbook `libraries` folder.
